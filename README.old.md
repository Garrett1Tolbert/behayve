Raise classroom behavior issues in real-time

Develop a referral process platform that helps teachers to raise and escalate major behavior issues in the classroom in real-time.

The platform would work like a classroom management tool that will help teachers to share real-­time information on their student’s classroom behaviors with students, other teachers, parents, and administrators.

The system should record all assessments made by the teachers for future reference and annual evaluations.
